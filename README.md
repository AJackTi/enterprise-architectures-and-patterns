# Enterprise Architectures & Patterns

This repository contains a collection of enterprise architectures and patterns, to illustrate the potential of [Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) and WebAssembly for building real-world applications.

Each folder contains a self-contained example, including some high-level explanation of the pattern/architecture and instructions on how to run the sample.
